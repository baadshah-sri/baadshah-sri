## 💡 About Me

I'm an aspiring engineer and researcher passionate about **real-time sensor fusion**, **inertial systems**, and **deep learning for 3D perception**.

- At **Sarissa GmbH**, I developed a motion-tracking system using **IMUs + Ultrasonic sensors**, performing Allan variance analysis and integrating embedded platforms (STM32 + Raspberry Pi Pico W).
- For my **Bachelor Thesis**, I’m working on a state-of-the-art pipeline involving **semantic segmentation**, **LiDAR projection**, and **3D object detection** using the **KITTI-360 dataset**.

- As I continue learning, I'm especially excited about working on projects in:

   -> Neural networks & model training

   -> Computer vision tasks like object detection & segmentation

   -> Data analysis, visualization, and storytelling with Python

I bring together embedded control, real-time perception, and machine learning to build systems that don't just learn—but act.
